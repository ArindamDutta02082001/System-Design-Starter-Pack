✅ 1. Fixed Window Counter

Simplest rate limiter.

Idea: Time is divided into fixed windows (1 sec, 2 sec or 1 min)

what to do :
Maintain a req counter for each user in a map
on incoming user req , check the curr time - start time <= window siz time ,
if no , remove userid from map , reset start time to curr time

at end
If count > req limit → return false

Pros:
Simple & fast (O(1)) , Easy to implement

Cons:
"Burst" problem at window boundaries

✅ 2. Sliding Window Log
Idea: Store timestamps of each request in a queue/log

Remove old timestamps continuously

Size of queue = number of requests in last X seconds

Pros:

Most accurate

Cons:

High memory usage for large traffic

Expensive inserts/deletes

✅ 3. Sliding Window Counter (SKIP not req)

Hybrid of fixed window + sliding log

Idea:

Use two windows: current & previous

Weighted calculation → smoothes traffic

Pros:

Less bursty than fixed window

Lower memory than sliding log

Cons:

Still approximate

✅ 4. Token Bucket (Most used in industry)
Idea:

A bucket stores tokens

Requests consume tokens

Tokens refill at a fixed rate (leaky tap)

If bucket empty → reject

Pros:

Allows bursts

Very efficient

Used by: AWS, Google Cloud, Nginx

Cons:

Slightly more complex

✅ 5. Leaky Bucket
Idea:

Queue of fixed size

Requests leak out at a fixed rate

If queue full → drop incoming requests

Pros:

Smooth, stable traffic

Cons:
