The key requirements are:

A cache with configurable capacity.  -- done
Implementation of write-through policy  -- done
        (sync DB in parallel on write action to the cache) --> agar ye bol dega you have to use parallel threading
Implementation of LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction.  -- done
        should be extendable to LFU -- done
Thread affinity for operations on the same key to maintain ordering & "read your own writes" -tbd
"Read your own writes" consistency guarantees. -- tbd
Use of Java generics for flexible key-value types. -- done
Extensible design for future write policies and eviction algorithms. -- done


We'll ignore request collapsing, hot loading, event logging, and head-of-line blocking.
        (We'll discuss these concepts in HLD course)
